### Progress Log:

- <strong>Date:</strong> 28/05/2018
	- Just wrote code.
	- Yet to implement on Arduino.
 	- Will be doing that tomorrow.
 	- Need to add a <a title="README.md" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Fish/blob/master/README.md">README</a>.

- <strong>Date:</strong> 29/05/2018
 	- Code now works with sensor.
 	- Added a piece of code to convert volts to distance.

- <strong>Date:</strong> 60/05/2018
 	- Up<strong>dated</strong> Bluetooth Code.
 	- Bluetooth now works over COM4 port.
 	- ```println()``` statements look much cleaner now

- <strong>Date:</strong> 31/05/2018
 	- Added EEPROM flush. Not much of an improvement.
 	- Bluetooth has not been integrated here.
	- Bluetooth code has been introduced, albeit very buggy as of now.

- <strong>Date:</strong> 08/05/2018
 	- Joystick can be used to control the fish now. Attempting on a wired controller though.
 	- Intereference. Need to upload a SLAVE communication.

- <strong>Date:</strong> 09/06/2018
 	- DualShock3 replaced with XBox 360 Wireless knockoff controller.
 	- Works much better now.
 	- SLAVE protocol has been established. Works much better.

- <strong>Date:</strong> 10/06/2018
 	- BLuetooth module has been converted into a one-way system, i.e. slave communication
 	- RX/TX can be connected simultaneously, no obstruction to communication from controller.

- <strong>Date:</strong> 13/06/2018
 	- Code has been successfully tested on fish.
 	- This code has been converted into a ```.cpp``` library, to make the Arduino code cleaner.

- <strong>Date:</strong> 15/06/2018
 	- The thermocol has ripped. Adhesive applied and trying to fix it.
 	- Code seems to be working well. Angles seem to be too big though.


- <strong>Date:</strong> 03/07/2018
	- Embargo due to mechanical issues.
	- A polythene wrapper has been used as a final layer for waterproofing the structure.
	- The issue is with fit. Almost fixed it.
	- Should have a great Fish by this weekend. Fingers crossed.
	- Try to code a more harmonic motion of Fish body.


- <strong>Date:</strong> 09/07/2018
	- Movement seems to work well, even without harmonic motion integration.
	- ```ICSP``` pins should not be used for power supply. ```V(in)``` pin solely supports 5V. ```V(in)``` should be used, along with corresponding ```GND``` pin.
	- Looking forward to 3D printing some of the components.

- <strong>Date:</strong> 14/07/2018
	- Plastic has been bound.
	- Compensations have been provided.
	- Waiting for adhesive to dry up.

- <strong>Date:</strong> 15/07/2018
	- Rubber based adhesive used to fill the last remaining holes.
	- Adhesive also used to coat the battery. Multiple times.
	- Tail fin and fish design <a title="Tail fin" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SarthakJShetty/Fish/master/Design%20Files/Mechanical_Design/Fish_Design/Fish_Assembly.png" target="_blank">updated</a>. Looks less like a kayaking paddle now.

- <strong>Date:</strong> 16/07/2018
	- Fish works great with plastic binding now.
	- Movements are unforced. Feels smooth. Finally this works.
	- Filled the last remaining slots and gaps in the plastic. Will cut out a cover for the Sharp sensor.
	- 3D printing of fin underway. We're almost there.
